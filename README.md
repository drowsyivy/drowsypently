# drowsypently

A fork of PinoBatch's music engine for NES that supports both NES
playback (with sound effects) and NSF. Purely for personal use.

Please use PinoBatch's original engine unless you have a good reason to
use this fork.

Documentation can be found in `docs/` and example tracks can be found in `musicseq.pently`.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- [Python] 3
- [ca65]
- GNU Make and Coreutils  
  On Windows, install [Git for Windows], and then follow
  [evanwill's instructions] to download GNU Make without Guile
  from [ezwinports] and merge it into Git Bash.
- For NES (not NSF) format: Pillow (Python imaging library)  
  UNIX: `python3 -m pip install pillow`  
  Windows: `py -3 -m pip install pillow`
- For FamiTracker conversion: [j0CC-FamiTracker] and [ft2pently]

For help setting up Python, ca65, Make, and Coreutils, see the README
file for [nrom-template].

### Building

Once you have the above installed, run `make` to build and play
or `make pently.nes` to only build a ROM.
Then edit the score and run `make` again to hear the changes.
To use an entirely different score file, open `makefile` and change
`scorename`, or use e.g. `make NTS.nsfe` or `make NTS.nes` to use
score file `audio/NTS.pently`.
To use a FamiTracker module, edit the `FAMITRACKER` and `FT2P` paths
in `makefile` to reflect executable paths on your system, then run
`make Foothills.nsf` to use score file `audio/Foothills.ftm`.
